**Duck Simulation Program**

**Description**

This Java program demonstrates the Strategy Design Pattern by modeling different types of ducks. Each duck has different behaviors for quacking, swimming, and flying, which can be dynamically assigned using interfaces. The program simulates various duck types and their unique behaviors.

**Features**
1. Implements the Strategy Pattern to manage duck behaviors.
2. Defines multiple duck types with customizable behaviors:
  Mallard Duck
  Red Head Duck
  Rubber Duck
  Decoy Duck
3. Uses interfaces for:
  Quacking (QuackBehaviour)
  Swimming (SwimBehaviour)
  Flying (FlyBehavior)
4. Allows easy modification of behaviors without altering existing duck classes.

**Usage**

2. Each duck displays its type and performs:
  Quacking
  Swimming
  Flying
3. Output is printed to the console.
